procedure to demonstrate the validity of MC algo:
1- Decide which distribution N we want to sample.
2- deltailed balance:
  K(o->n)=K(n->o)

with K(o->n)= N(o) x alpha(o->n) x acc(o->n)

3- Determine the probabilities of generating a particular configuration.

4- Derive the condition which needs to be fulfilled by the acceptance rules.
