Procedure to demonstrate the validity of MC algo:
1- Decide which distribution N we want to sample.
2- deltailed balance:
  K(o->n)=K(n->o)

with K(o->n)= N(o) x alpha(o->n) x acc(o->n)

3- Determine the probabilities of generating a particular configuration.

4- Derive the condition which needs to be fulfilled by the acceptance rules.

MC simulation:

1- select a particle  o
2- random displacement o-> n
3- the move is accepted with a probability

   acc(o->n) = min(1,exp(-beta[U(n)-U[o]]))


Justification:

Here

alpha(o->n)=alpha(n->o)=alpha

substitution in in the detailed balance:
	       acc(o->n)/acc(n->o)= exp(-beta (U(n)-U(o))))

Our rule obeys this condition.
