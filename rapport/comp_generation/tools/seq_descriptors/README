Description
-----------

This archive contains sequence analysis scripts (in the lib folder) and
a complete example of application (seq_descriptors.sh).

Typical usage is the comparison of designed sequences with reference
sequences, the latter can for example be a single native sequence or a
Pfam alignment.

Various sequence properties are calculated, such as sequence identity
and similarity scores with respect to the reference sequence or
alignment, charge, mass, volume, reference energy, etc. Some properties
are also calculated by position.

In order to be general, the scripts handle sequences in the SEQ format,
which is the simplest multiple alignment format (one sequence by line,
nothing else). Sequences in any format can thus be treated after
conversion to the SEQ format.

For more details, read code and comments in scripts.
