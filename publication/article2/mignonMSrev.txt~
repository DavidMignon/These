Short title: Computational design of PDZ domains

Abstract
PDZ domains direct protein-protein interactions and serve as models for protein design.
Here, we optimized a protein design energy function for the Tiam1 and Cask PDZ domains that combines a molecular mechanics energy, Generalized Born solvent, and an
empirical unfolded state model. Designed sequences were recognized as PDZ domains
by the Superfamily fold recognition tool and had similarity scores comparable to natural
PDZ sequences. The optimized model was used to redesign two PDZ domains, by gradually varying the chemical potential of hydrophobic amino acids; the tendency of each
position to lose or gain a hydrophobic character represents a novel hydrophobicity index.
We also redesigned four positions in the Tiam1 PDZ domain involved in peptide binding specificity. The calculated affinity differences between designed variants reproduced
experimental data and suggest substitutions with altered specificities.

Introduction

PDZ domains (‚ÄúPostsynaptic density-95/Discs large/Zonula occludens-1‚Äù) are small, globular protein domains that establish protein-protein interaction networks in the cell 1‚Äì6 .
They form specific interactions with other, target proteins, usually by recognizing a few
amino acids at the target C-terminus. Due to their biological importance, PDZ domains
and their interaction with target proteins have been extensively studied and computationally engineered. Peptide ligands have been designed that modulate the activity of
PDZ domains involved in various pathologies 7‚Äì9 . Engineered PDZ domains and PDZ
ligands have been used to elucidate principles of protein folding and evolution 10‚Äì13 . In
addition, these small domains with their peptide ligands provide benchmarks to test the
computational methods themselves 14‚Äì16 .
An emerging method that has been applied to several PDZ domains is computational
protein design (CPD) 17‚Äì22 . Starting from a three-dimensional (3D) structural model, CPD
explores a large space of amino acid sequences and conformations to identify protein variants that have predefined properties, such as stability or ligand binding. Conformational
space is usually defined by a discrete or continuous library of sidechain rotamers and by
a finite set of backbone conformations or a specific repertoire of allowed backbone deformations. The energy function that drives CPD usually combines physical and empirical
terms 23‚Äì25 , while the solvent and the protein unfolded state are described implicitly.
Here, we considered a simple but important class of CPD models. The energy is a
physics-based function of the ‚ÄúMMGBSA‚Äù type, which combines a molecular mechanics
protein energy with a Generalized Born + surface area implicit solvent. The folded
protein is represented by a single, fixed, backbone conformation and a discrete sidechain
rotamer library. The unfolded state energy depends only on sequence composition, not an
explicit structural model. The main adjustable model parameters are the protein dielectric
constant P , a small set of atomic surface energy coefficients œÉi , and a collection of amino
acid chemical potentials, or ‚Äúreference energies‚Äù Etr . Each surface coefficient measures the
preference of a particular atom type to be solvent-exposed, while each reference energy
represents the contribution of a single amino acid of type t to the unfolded state energy.
The model is implemented in the Proteus software 26‚Äì28 .
The present physics-based energy function can be compared to more empirical ones,
2

of which the most successful is the Rosetta energy function 29‚Äì31 . The Rosetta function
includes a Lennard-Jones repulsion term, a Coulomb term, a hydrogen-bonding term,
a Lazaridis-Karplus solvation term 32 , and unfolded state reference energies. It has a
large number of parameters specifically optimized for CPD, which provide optimal performance, but less transferability and a less transparent physical interpretation. Proteus
also provides some specific functionalities, such as Replica Exchange Monte Carlo, various
importance sampling methods, and the ability to compute free energies that are formally
exact 33‚Äì35 .
We optimized the reference energies Etr for the Tiam1 and Cask PDZ proteins, using a maximum likelihood formalism. We compared two values of the protein dielectric
constant, P = 4 and 8. These values gave good results in a systematic study that compared dielectric constants in the range 1‚Äì32 36 . The performance of the model was tested
by generating designed sequences for both proteins and comparing them to natural sequences, as well as sequences generated with the Rosetta energy function and software 37 .
The sequence design was performed by running long Monte Carlo simulations where all
protein positions except Gly and Pro were allowed to mutate freely, leading to thousands
of designed protein variants. The testing included cross-validation, where the reference
energies were optimized using one set of PDZ domains, then applied to others. We also
performed 100‚Äì1000 nanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a few of the
sequences designed with our optimized CPD model, to help assess their stability. Ten
sequences were stable over 100 ns or more and one over 1000 ns of MD simulation.
We then applied the CPD model with optimized parameters to two problems, which
are representative of the two main areas we are interested in: exploring the plasticity of
sequence space for PDZ domains and designing strong and specific PDZ ligands. Earlier
applications in these areas mostly employed empirical, knowledge-based energy functions
such as the Rosetta function 9,10,13,14 . First, we performed a series of Monte Carlo simulations of two PDZ domains where the chemical potential of the hydrophobic amino
acid types was gradually increased, artificially biasing the protein composition. As the
hydrophobic bias was increased, hydrophobic amino acids gradually invaded the protein
from the inside out, forming a hydrophobic core that became larger than the natural one.
The propensity of each core position to become hydrophobic at a high or low level of bias
can be seen as a structure-dependent hydrophobicity index, which provides information
3

on the designability or plasticity of the protein core. The second application consisted in
designing four Tiam1 positions known to be involved in specific target recognition. These
four positions were varied through Monte Carlo simulations of either the apo-protein or
the protein in complex with two distinct peptide ligands. The simulations were in agreement with experimental sequences and binding affinities, and suggest new variants that
could have altered specificities. This application is a step towards the design of strong
peptide binders, which could be of use as reagents or inhibitors in vitro or in vivo.

2.1

The unfolded state model
Maximum likelihood reference energies

The Monte Carlo method employed here generates a Markov chain of states 38,39 , such that
the states are populated according to a Boltzmann distribution. The energy employed is
not the folded protein‚Äôs energy, but rather its folding energy, i.e., the difference between
its folded and unfolded state energies 33 . One possible elementary move is a ‚Äúmutation‚Äù,
we modify the sidechain type t ‚Üí t0 at a chosen position i in the folded protein, assigning
a particular rotamer r0 to the new sidechain. We consider the same mutation in the
unfolded state. For a particular sequence S, the unfolded state energy has the form:
Eu =

X

E r (ti ).

(1)

i‚ààS

The sum is over all amino acids; ti represents the sidechain type at position i. The
type-dependent quantities E r (t) ‚â° Etr are referred to as ‚Äúreference energies‚Äù; they can be
thought of as effective chemical potentials of each amino acid type. The folding energy
change due to a mutation thus has the form:

‚àÜE = ‚àÜE f ‚àí ‚àÜE u = E f (...t0i , ri0 ...) ‚àí E f (...ti , ri ...) ‚àí (E r (t0i ) ‚àí E r (ti ))

(2)

where ‚àÜE f and ‚àÜE u are the energy changes in the folded and unfolded state, respectively.
The reference energies are essential parameters in the simulation model. Our goal here
is to choose them empirically so that the simulation produces amino acid frequencies
that match a set of target values, for example experimental values in the Pfam database.
4

Specifically, we will choose them so as to maximize the probability, or likelihood of the
target sequences.
Let S be a particular sequence. Its Boltzmann probability is
p(S) =

1
exp(‚àíŒ≤‚àÜGS ),
Z

(3)

where ‚àÜGS = GfS ‚àí ESu is the folding free energy of S, GfS is the free energy of the folded
form, Œ≤ = 1/kT is the inverse temperature and Z is a normalizing constant (the partition
function). We then have
kT ln p(S) =

X

E r (ti ) ‚àí GfS ‚àí kT ln Z =

X

nS (t)Etr ‚àí GfS ‚àí kT ln Z,

(4)

t‚ààaa

i‚ààS

where the sum on the right is over the amino acid types and nS (t) is the number of amino
acids of type t within the sequence S.
We now consider a set S of N target sequences S; we denote L the probability of the
entire set, which depends on the model parameters Etr ; we refer to L as their likelihood 40 .
We have
kT ln L =

XX
S

nS (t)Etr ‚àí

GfS ‚àí N kT ln Z =

where N (t) is the number of amino acids of type t in the whole dataset S. The normalization factor or partition function Z is a sum over all possible sequences R:
Z=

exp(‚àíŒ≤‚àÜGR ) =

R

X

exp(‚àíŒ≤‚àÜGfR )Œ†t‚ààaa exp(Œ≤nR (t)Etr )

(6)

In view of maximizing L, we consider the derivative of Z with respect to one of the Etr :

(8)

The quantity on the right is the Boltzmann average of the number n(t) of amino acids
t over all possible sequences. In practice, this is the average population of t we would
obtain in a long MC simulation. As usual in statistical mechanics 41 , the derivative of
5

ln Z with respect to one quantity (Etr ) is equal to the ensemble average of the conjugate
quantity (Œ≤nS (t)).
A necessary condition to maximize ln L is that its derivatives with respect to the Etr
should all be zero. We see that

(9)

so that
N (t)
= hn(t)i, ‚àÄt ‚àà aa
(10)
N
Thus, to maximize L, we should choose {Etr } such that a long simulation gives the same
L maximum =‚áí

amino acid frequencies as the target database.

2.2

Searching for the maximum likelihood

We will use two methods to approach the maximum likelihood {Etr } values, starting from
a current guess {Etr (n)}. With the first method, we step along the gradient of ln L, using
the update rule 40 :
Etr (n + 1) = Etr (n) + Œ±

‚àÇ
ln L = Etr (n) + Œ¥E (nexp
‚àí hn(t)in )
t
‚àÇEtr

(11)

Here, Œ± is a constant; nexp
= N (t)/N is the mean population of amino acid type t in
t
the target database; hin indicates an average over a simulation done using the current
reference energies {Etr (n)}, and Œ¥E is an empirical constant with the dimension of an
energy, referred to as the update amplitude. This update procedure is repeated until
convergence. We refer to this method as the linear update method.
The second method, used previously 26,27 , employs a logarithmic update rule:
Etr (n + 1) = Etr (n) + kT ln

hn(t)in
nexp
t

(12)

where kT is a thermal energy, set empirically to 0.5 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J). We refer to
this as the logarithmic update method. Both the linear and logarithmic update methods
converge to the same optimum, specified by (Eq. 10).
In the later iterations, some Etr values tended to converge slowly, with an oscillatory
behavior. Therefore, we sometimes used a modified update rule, where the Etr (n + 1) ‚àí
6

Etr (n) value computed with the linear or logarithmic method for iteration n was mixed
with the value computed at the previous iteration, with the (n ‚àí 1) value having a weight
of 1/3 and the current value a weight of 2/3. At each iteration, we typically ran 500
million steps (per replica) of Replica Exchange Monte Carlo.

Computational methods
Effective energy function for the folded state

The energy matrix was computed with the following effective energy function for the
folded state:
E = Ebonds + Eangles + Edihe + Eimpr + Evdw + ECoul + Esolv

(13)

The first six terms in Eq. (13) represent the protein internal energy. They were taken from
the Amber ff99SB empirical energy function 42 , slightly modified for CPD. The original
backbone charges were replaced by a unified set, obtained by averaging over all amino acid
types and adjusting slightly to make the backbone portion of each amino acid neutral 43 .
The last term on the right of Eq. (13), Esolv , represents the contribution of solvent. We
used a ‚ÄúGeneralized Born + Surface Area‚Äù, or GBSA implicit solvent model 44 :

œÉi Ai
2 W
P
ij
i
(14)
Here, W and P are the solvent and protein dielectric constants; rij is the distance
between atoms i, j and bi is the ‚Äúsolvation radius‚Äù of atom i 44,45 . Ai is the exposed solvent
accessible surface area of atom i; œÉi is a parameter that reflects each atom‚Äôs preference
to be exposed or hidden from solvent. The solute atoms were divided into four groups
with specific œÉi values. The values were -5 (nonpolar), -40 (aromatic), -80 (polar), and
-100 (ionic) cal/mol/AÃä2 . Hydrogen atoms were assigned a surface coefficient of 0. Surface
areas were computed by the Lee and Richards algorithm 46 , implemented in the XPLOR
program 47 , using a 1.5 AÃä probe radius. The MC simulations used a protein dielectric of
P = 4 or 8.

7

In the GB energy term, the atomic solvation radius bi approximates the distance
from i to the protein surface and is a function of the coordinates of all the protein atoms.
The particular bi form corresponds to a GB variant we call GB/HCT, after its original
authors 44 , with model parameters optimized for use with the Amber force field 45 . Since
bi depends on the coordinates of all the solute atoms 44 , an additional approximation is
needed to make the GB energy term pairwise additive and to define the energy matrix 27,48 .
We use a ‚ÄúNative Environment Approximation‚Äù, or NEA, where the solvation radius bi
of each particular group (backbone, sidechain or ligand) is computed ahead of time, with
the rest of the system having its native sequence and conformation 27,48 .
The surface energy contribution Esurf is not pairwise additive either, because in a
protein structure, surface area buried by one sidechain may also be buried by another.
To make this energy pairwise, we used the method of Street et al. 49 . In this method,
the buried surface of a sidechain is computed by summing over the neighboring sidechain
and backbone groups. For each neighboring group, the contact area with the sidechain of
interest is computed, independently of other surrounding groups. The contact areas are
then summed. To avoid overcounting the buried surface area, a scaling factor is applied
to the contact areas involving buried sidechains. Previous studied showed that a scaling
factor of 0.65 works well 45,48 .

3.2

Reference energies in the unfolded state

In the CPD model, the unfolded state energy depends on the sequence composition
through a set of reference energies Etr (Eq. 1). Here, the reference energies were assigned based on amino acid types t, taking into account also the position of each amino
acid in the folded structure, through its buried or solvent-exposed character. Thus, for
a given type (Ala, say), there were two distinct Etr values: a buried and an exposed
value. This is so even though the reference energies are used to represent the unfolded,
not the folded state. This procedure is supported by three assumptions. First, we assume residual structure is present in the unfolded state, so that amino acids partly retain
their buried/exposed character. Second, we hypothesize that the unfolded state model
compensates in a systematic way for errors in the folded state energy function, so that
the folded structure contributes indirectly to the reference energies. Third, this strategy
8

makes the model less sensitive to variations in the length of surface loops, and to the
proportion of surface vs. buried residues, which can vary widely among homologs (see
below). As a result, the model should be more transferable within a protein family.
Distinguishing buried/exposed positions doubles the number of adjustable Etr parameters. Conversely, to reduce the number of adjustable parameters, we group amino
acids into homologous classes (given in Results). Within each class c, and for each type
of position (buried or exposed), the reference energies have the form
Etr = Ecr + Œ¥Etr

(15)

Here, Ecr is an adjustable parameter while Œ¥Etr is a constant, computed as the molecular
mechanics energy difference between amino acid types within the class c, assuming an
unfolded conformation where each amino acid interacts only with itself and with solvent.
Specifically, we ran MC simulations of an extended peptide (the Syndecan1 peptide; see
below) and computed the average energies for each amino acid type at each peptide position (excluding the termini). We took the differences between amino acid types and averaged them over the peptide positions. During likelihood maximization, Ecr is optimized
while Œ¥Etr is held fixed. To optimize the Ecr values, we apply the linear or logarithmic
method while the target frequencies correspond to the experimental frequencies of the
exp
amino acid classes, nexp
c , rather than of the individual types (nt , above).

3.3

Experimental sequences and structural models

We considered the Tiam1 and Cask PDZ domains, whose crystal structures are known
(PDB codes 4GVD and 1KWA, respectively). They both belong to the class II binding
motif 3 , which recognizes the pattern Œ¶-X-Œ¶ at the C-terminus of its peptide ligand, where
Œ¶ is a hydrophobic amino acid. To define the target amino acid frequencies for likelihood
maximization, we collected homologous sequences for each PDZ domain. We identified
homologous sequences by using the Blast tool to search the Uniprot database, with the
sequences taken from the PDB file as the query and the Blosum62 scoring matrix. We
retained homologs with a sequence identity, relative to the query, above a 60% threshold
and below an 85% threshold. If two homologs had a mutual sequence identity above
95%, one of the two was viewed as redundant and was discarded. This led to 50 Tiam1
9

and 126 Cask homolog sequences. The two sets of homologs are referred to as HT and
HC , respectively. For each of the sets, say H, we average over all homologs and all
positions to obtain compute the overall amino acid frequencies. The averaging is done
separately for buried and exposed positions. The resulting amino acid frequencies are
denoted {ftb (H), fte (H)}, where the subscript t represents an amino acid type and the
superscripts b, e refer to buried and exposed positions, respectively. Finally, the sets of
mean frequencies derived from HT and HC were themselves averaged, giving the overall

target amino acid frequencies, ftb = ftb (HT ) + ftb (HC ) /2 for each type t, and similarly
for the exposed positions. Distinct target frequencies were thus obtained for buried and
exposed positions.
Model parameterization and testing were mostly done for the apo state of each protein. However, for Cask, no apo X-ray structure was available at the beginning of this
work, so a holo-like structure was used, where the peptide binding site is occupied by the
C-terminus of another PDZ domain in the crystal lattice; the apo state was then modelled
by removing this peptide. For the PDZ domain of Tiam1, we also used a holo structure
then modelled the apo state by removing the peptide. For this PDZ domain, the backbone rms deviation between the apo and holo X-ray structures is just 0.5 AÃä; therefore, we
expect the CPD model to be transferable between apo/holo Tiam1 states. For additional
testing, we also considered two class I PDZ domains, syntenin and DLG2 (second PDZ
domain in both cases), which recognize the pattern S/T-X-Œ¶ at the C-terminus of its
peptide ligand. Their X-ray structures are 1R6J and 2BYG, respectively. In both these
structures, the peptide ligand was not co-crystallized, but the peptide binding site of each
PDZ domain was partly occupied by the C-terminus of another protein molecule in the
crystal lattice. The structures employed are listed in Table 1.
To carry out the Monte Carlo design calculations, the structures were prepared and
energy matrices computed using procedures described previously 15,50 . Two missing segments in the Tiam1 PDZ domain (residues 851-854 and 868-869) were built using the
Modeller program 51 . The peptide ligand was removed from the PDB structure for most
of the design calculations before computing the energy matrix. For each pair of amino
acid side chains, the interaction energy was computed after 15 steps of energy minimization, with the backbone held fixed and only the interactions of the pair with each other
and the backbone included 26 . This short minimization alleviates the discrete rotamer
10

approximation. Side chain rotamers were described by a slightly expanded version of the
library of Tuffery et al 52 , which has a total of 254 rotamers (summed over all amino acid
types). This expanded library includes additional hydrogen orientations for OH and SH
groups 48 . This rotamer library was chosen for its simplicity and because it gave very good
performance in sidechain placement tests, comparable to the specialized Scwrl4 program
(which uses a much larger library) 53,54 .

3.4

Monte Carlo simulations

Sequence design was performed with Proteus, which runs long Monte Carlo (MC) simulations where selected amino acid positions can mutate freely. The choice of mutating
positions is user-defined and depends on the specific design challenge. Four different
choices occurred in the present work. First, to optimize the reference energies, we did
simulations where about half of the positions could mutate at a time. Second, the optimized models were tested in simulations where all positions except Gly and Pro were
free to mutate. Hydrophobic titration of two PDZ domains also employed this choice.
Third, to produce designed sequences to test through molecular dynamics, we did MC
simulations where Gly, Pro, and 11 positions closely involved in peptide binding were
held fixed, while all other positions were allowed to mutate. Fourth, in the second Tiam1
application, only four positions in the protein could mutate. In all these cases (with two
exceptions), mutations occurred randomly, subject only to the MMGBSA energy function
that drives the simulation. In only two cases, an additional, ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù energy term
was used to explicitly bias the simulation to stay close to the natural, Pfam sequences.
The Monte Carlo simulations used one- and two-position moves, where either rotamers, amino acid types, or both changed. For two-position moves, the second position
was selected among those that had a significant interaction energy with the first (i.e.,
there was at least one rotamer conformation where their unsigned interaction energy was
10 kcal/mol or more). In addition, sampling was enhanced by Replica Exchange Monte
Carlo (REMC), where several MC simulations (‚Äúreplicas‚Äù or ‚Äúwalkers‚Äù) were run in parallel, at different temperatures. Periodic swaps were attempted between the conformations
of two walkers i, j (adjacent in temperature). The swap was accepted with the probability


acc(swapij ) = Min 1, e(Œ≤i ‚àíŒ≤j )(‚àÜEi ‚àí‚àÜEj )
11

(16)

where Œ≤i , Œ≤j are the inverse temperatures of the two walkers and ‚àÜEi , ‚àÜEj are the
changes in their folding energies due to the conformation change 55,56 . We used eight
walkers, with thermal energies kTi that range from 0.125 to 3 kcal/mol, spaced in a
geometric progression: Ti+1 /Ti = constant 55 . Simulations were done with the proteus
program (which is part of the Proteus package) 27 . REMC was implemented with an
efficient, shared-memory, OpenMP parallelization 33 .
One simulation of Tiam1 and one of Case were done that included an ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù,
biasing energy term, which penalized sequences that had a low similarity to a reference,
experimental set. The bias energy had the form
Œ¥Ebias = c

X


Sirand ‚àí S(ti ) ,

where the sum extends over the amino acid positions i; ti is the sidechain type at position
i; S(ti ) is the (dimensionless) Blosum40 similarity score versus the corresponding position
in the Pfam RP55 sequence alignment; Sirand is the mean score (versus the same Pfam
column) for a random type (where all types are equiprobable), and c = 0.5 kcal/mol.

3.5

Rosetta sequence generation

Monte Carlo simulations were also performed using the Rosetta program and energy
function 37 . The simulations were done using version 2015.38.58158 of Rosetta (freely
available online), using the command
fixbb -s Tiam1.pdb -resfile Tiam1.res -nstruct 10000 -ex1 -ex2 -linmem_ig 10

where the ex1 and ex2 options activate an enhanced rotamer search for buried sidechains,
the last option (linmem ig) corresponds to on-the-fly energy calculation, and default parameters were used otherwise. Gly and Pro residues present in the wildtype protein were
not allowed to mutate, and positions that do mutate could not change into Gly or Pro (as
with the Proteus design simulations). Simulations were run for each PDZ domain until
10,000 unique low energy sequences were identified, corresponding to run times of about
5 minutes per sequence on a single core of a recent Intel processor, for a total of 10 hours
(per protein) using 80 cores. This was comparable to the cost of the Proteus calculations
(energy matrix plus Monte Carlo simulations).
12

3.6

Sequence characterization

Designed sequences were compared to the Pfam alignment for the PDZ family, using the
Blosum40 scoring matrix and a gap penalty of -6. This matrix is appropriate for comparing
rather distant homologs (CPD and Pfam sequences in this case). Each Pfam sequence was
also compared to the Pfam alignment, which allowed for comparison between the designed
sequences and a typical pair of natural PDZ domains. For these Pfam/Pfam comparisons,
if a test PDZ domain T was part of the Pfam alignment, the T/T self-comparison was left
out, to be more consistent with the designed/Pfam comparisons. The Pfam alignment
was the ‚ÄúRP55‚Äù alignment, consisting of 12,255 sequences. Similarities were computed
separately for the 14 core residues and 16 surface residues, defined by their near-complete
burial or exposure (listed in Results) and for the entire protein.
Designed sequences were submitted to the Superfamily library of Hidden Markov
Models 57,58 , which attempts to classify sequences according to the Structural Classification
Of Proteins, or SCOP 59 . Classification was based on SCOP version 1.75 and version 3.5
of the Superfamily tools. Superfamily executes the hmmscan program, which implements
a Hidden Markov model for each SCOP family and superfamily. The hmmscan program
was executed using an E-value threshold of 10‚àí10 and a total of 15,438 models to represent
the SCOP database.
To compare the diversity in the designed sequences with the diversity in natural
sequences, we used the standard, position-dependent sequence entropy 60 , computed as
follows:
Si = ‚àí

6
X

fj (i) ln fj (i)

(18)

j=1

where fj (i) is the frequency of residue type j at position i, either in the designed sequences
or in the natural sequences (organized into a multiple alignment). Instead of the usual,
20 amino acid types, we employed six residue classes, corresponding to the following
groups: {LVIMC}, {FYW}, {G}, {ASTP}, {EDNQ}, and {KRH}. This classification
was obtained by a cluster analysis of the BLOSUM62 matrix 61 , and by analyzing residueresidue contact energies in proteins 62 . To obtain a sense for how many amino acid types
appeared at a typical position, we report the residue entropy in its exponential form,
exp(S) (which ranges from 1 to 6), averaged over the protein chain.

13

3.7

Protein:peptide binding free energies

For the Tiam1 PDZ domain, we used design calculations in the presence and absence
of a bound peptide to obtain estimates of the binding free energy differences between
protein variants. If a given sequence S was sampled in both the apo and holo states, we
computed the mean energy hEholo (S)i, hEapo (S)i in each of the two states by averaging
over the sampled conformations. Then, we took the difference
‚àÜ‚àÜE(S, S 0 ) = (hEholo (S 0 )i ‚àí hEapo (S 0 )i) ‚àí (hEholo (S)i ‚àí hEapo (S)i)

(19)

as our estimate of the binding free energy difference between the variants S and S 0 . We
also computed binding free energy differences between groups of homologous sequences,
say S and S 0 , by pooling the homologous sequences sampled in either the apo or holo
state, then averaging over the conformations sampled and taking the energy difference
‚àÜ‚àÜE(S, S 0 ).

3.8

Molecular dynamics simulations

Wildtype and a quadruple mutant Tiam1 and ten sequences designed with Proteus were
subjected to MD simulations with explicit solvent and no peptide ligand. The starting
structures were taken from the MC trajectory or the crystal structure (wildtype protein
and quadruple mutant: PDB codes 4GVD and 4NXQ) and slightly minimized with harmonic restraints to maintain the backbone geometry. The protein was immersed in a
large box of non-overlapping waters. The solvated system was truncated to the shape of
a truncated octahedral box using the Charmm graphical interface or GUI 63 . The minimum distance between protein atoms and the box was 15 AÃä and the final models included
about 11,000 water molecules. A few sodium or chloride ions were included to ensure
overall electroneutrality. The protonation states of histidines were assigned to be neutral, based on visual inspection. MD was done at room temperature and pressure, using
a Nose-Hoover thermostat and barostat 64,65 . Long-range electrostatic interactions were
treated with a Particle Mesh Ewald approach 66 . The Amber ff99SB force field and the
TIP3P model 67 were used for the protein and water, respectively. Simulations were run
for 100‚Äì1000 nanoseconds, depending on the sequence, using the Charmm and NAMD
programs 68,69 .

Results
Experimental structures and sequences

Three dimensional (3D) structures of the four test PDZ domains are shown in Fig. 1A.
Fourteen core residues (identified visually) superimposed well between the structures,
while loops and chain termini displayed large deviations. The Tiam1 Œ±2 helix is rotated slightly outwards compared to the other three structures 70 . Fig. 1B illustrates the
similarity between pairs of PDZ domains, as determined by the rms deviation between
structurally-aligned CŒ± atoms and the pairwise sequence identities. The rms deviations are
between 1.0 and 2.1 AÃä and the sequence identities between 17 and 33%. The Tiam1/Cask
sequence identity is 33% and their structural deviation is 1.7 AÃä based on 42 aligned CŒ±
atoms. The syntenin and DLG2 structures are more similar, with a structural deviation
of 1.0 AÃä based on 60 aligned CŒ± atoms.
Sequence conservation within the four PDZ domains and a subset of the Pfam seed
alignment is shown in Fig. 2. The 14 positions used to define the hydrophobic core are
highly, although not totally conserved within the Pfam seed alignment. Arginine, Lys
and Gln appear at some of the positions, since in small proteins like PDZ domains, the
long hydrophobic portion of these side chains can be buried in the core while still allowing
the polar tip of the sidechain to be exposed to solvent. A few Asp and Glu residues also
appear, in places where the sequence alignment may not reflect closely the 3D sidechain
superposition.

Optimizing the unfolded state model

We optimized the reference energies Etr for Tiam1 and Cask, using their natural homologs
to define the target amino acid frequencies. The protein dielectric constant P was either 4
or 8, with P =8 giving the best results. The Etr optimizations all converged to within 0.05
kcal/mol after about 20 iterations for most amino acid types, and to within 0.1 kcal/mol
for the others (the weakly-populated types), using either the linear or the logarithmic
method (Eq. 11 or 12). Table 2 indicates the final reference energies. The Etr values
were compared to, and agreed qualitatively with the energies computed from an extended
peptide structure, which provides a less empirical model of the unfolded state. Table 3
15

compares the amino acid frequencies from the natural homologs and the simulations using
parameters optimized with P =8. Results obtained using parameters optimized with P =4
are given in Supplementary Material. The theoretical population of the different amino
acid classes agreed well with experiment, with rms deviations of about 1%, for both the
exposed and buried positions. The agreement for the amino acid types was less good,
with rms deviations of 3.9%/2.4% (buried/exposed positions). The intra-class frequency
distributions depend explicitly on the energy offsets Œ¥Etr defined within each class, which
were computed with molecular mechanics (see Methods, Eq. 15).

4.3

Assessing designed sequence quality

Family recognition tests Proteus design simulations used Replica Exchange Monte
Carlo with eight replicas and 750 million steps per replica, at thermal energies kT that
ranged from 0.125 to 3 kcal/mol. All positions (except Gly and Pro) were allowed to
mutate freely into all amino acid types except Gly and Pro. The simulations were done
with the MMGBSA energy function, without any bias towards natural sequences or any
limit on the number of mutations. The 10,000 sequences with the lowest energies among
those sampled by any of the MC replicas were retained for analysis, along with the 10,000
Rosetta sequences. These sequences were analyzed by the Superfamily fold recognition
tool 58,71 (Table 4). With a protein dielectric constant of 8, we obtained a high percentage
of sequences assigned to the correct family: 91% for Tiam1 and 100% for Cask, with
E-values of around 10‚àí3 for the family assignments. These values are similar to Rosetta
(90 and 98% family recognition for Tiam1 and Cask). Changing the protein dielectric
constant to P =4 gave somewhat poorer results for Tiam1, with 53% of the sequences
designed with Proteus correctly recognized by Superfamily.
Sequences and sequence diversity Tiam1 and Cask sequences predicted by Proteus
and Rosetta as well as natural sequences are shown in Fig. 3 for the fourteen core residues
and in Fig. 4 for the sixteen surface residues (Tiam1 only). The sequences are represented
as sequence logos. As seen in many previous CPD studies 30,72 , agreement with experiment
for the core residues is very good, while agreement for the surface residues is much poorer.
The behavior of surface positions was also probed by designing each position individually,

16

with the rest of the protein free to explore rotamers but not mutations (‚Äúmono-position‚Äù
design). The corresponding logo (Fig. 4) shows an excess of Arg and Lys residues, suggesting that the CPD reference energies are not yet fully optimal, despite the extensive
empirical Etr tuning. Sequence similarity scores are given in the next subsection.
The diversity of the natural and designed sequences was characterized by a mean,
exponential sequence entropy (see Methods), which corresponds to a mean number of
sampled sequence classes per position. For example, a value of 2 at a particular position
indicates that amino acids from two of the six classes are present at that position within
the set of analyzed sequences. An overall average value of two indicates that on average,
two amino acid classes are present at any position within the analyzed sequences. For
reference, the Pfam RP55 set of 12,255 natural sequences has a mean entropy of 3.4.
Pooling the designed Tiam1 and Cask sequences gave an entropy of 2.2 with Rosetta and
2.0 with Proteus, indicating that these two backbone geometries cannot accomodate as
much diversity as the much larger RP55 set. Taking the 10,000 lowest energy sequences
sampled with the room temperature Monte Carlo replica (instead of the 10,000 lowest
energies sampled collectively by all replicas at all temperatures) and pooling Tiam1 and
Cask as before gave a higher overall entropy of 2.9 with Proteus. With Rosetta, entropy
in the core was only slightly below the average over all positions. With Proteus, it was
distinctly lower (1.25). For the Pfam-RP55 sequences, it was 1.8.
Blosum similarity scores Fig. 5 shows the computed Blosum40 similarity scores between designed and natural sequences. With Proteus, for both Tiam1 and Cask, the
overall similarities overlapped with the bottom of the peak of the natural scores, and
were comparable to the values for the Rosetta sequences. For the surface residues, shown
separately, similarity to the natural sequences was low (scores below zero), both for Proteus and Rosetta. With a protein dielectric constant of 4, Proteus performed about as
well as with P =8, giving almost the same similarity averaged over all Tiam1 and Cask
positions, for example.
While the similarity scores vs. Pfam with Proteus were comparable to Rosetta (Fig.
5), the identity scores vs. the wildtype sequence were significantly higher with Rosetta.
Identity scores excluding (respectively, including) Gly and Pro positions (which did not
mutate) were 20% (28%) for Proteus vs. 26% (34%) for Rosetta. Evidently, for Tiam1
17

and Cask, Rosetta performed ‚âà5 fewer mutations than Proteus.
For certain applications, we may need to specifically explore a sequence space region
very similar to Pfam, beyond the similarity provided by an MMGBSA energy. This can be
achieved by adding to the energy an ‚Äúexperimental,‚Äù or bias energy term that explicitly
favors high sequence scores. Fig. 5 includes results that use such a biased energy term:
by construction, it leads to very high similarity scores. A bias energy term could also be
used to limit the total number of mutations.
Cross-validation tests As a first cross-validation test, we applied the reference energies optimized using Tiam1 and Cask homologs (with P =8) to two other PDZ domains:
DLG2 and syntenin. The Superfamily scores were comparable to those obtained for Tiam1
and Cask, with 100% family recognition (Table 4). Sequences designed with Rosetta for
DLG2 and syntenin also gave 100% family recognition. For further cross-validation, we
optimized reference energies using an alternate set of PDZ domains: DLG2, syntenin,
PSD95, GRIP, INAD, and NHERF. Target frequencies were defined by a small set of their
natural homologs. We used P =8. To distinguish the new and initial model variants, we
refer to the new variant as the n=6 model (it uses six PDZ domains for parameterization), and the initial model as the ‚ÄúT+C‚Äù model (it used Tiam1 and Cask). The new,
n=6 reference energies were then used to produce designed Tiam1 and Cask sequences,
which were subjected to Superfamily tests and similarity calculations. The Superfamily
performance for Tiam1 was slightly degraded, compared to the previous, T+C model.
The Tiam1 Superfamily score decreased from 90.6% to 76.6% for family recognition. The
Cask score was unchanged. Histograms of Blosum similarity scores (Supplementary Material) show that the overall scores for Tiam1 and Cask with n=6 were very similar to the
T+C model, while the scores for the core positions were actually shifted to higher, not
lower values. For DLG2 and syntenin, we also computed similarity scores using both the
initial, T+C parameterization and the new, n=6 parameterization. The similarity scores
with the T+C model were slightly poorer than with the n=6 model, as expected. The
overall score decreased by about 20 points for syntenin and about 10 points for DLG2
(Supplementary Material). Overall, the cross-validated models gave slightly degraded
performance. Thus, for any PDZ domain of interest, it may be preferable to optimize reference energies specifically for that domain, rather than transferring values parameterized
18

using other PDZ domains.

4.4

Stability of designed sequences in molecular dynamics simulations

As another test of the design model, ten Tiam1 sequences designed with Proteus were
subjected to molecular dynamics simulations (MD) using an explicit solvent environment.
These sequences were obtained using Proteus with either P =8 or the less polarizable
value P =4. Although no peptide ligand was present during the design simulations, 11
positions in the binding pocket that make close contact with the peptide when it is
present were not allowed to mutate. This was done to allow future experimental testing of
designed sequences by a peptide binding assay. Among the 2,500 lowest energy designed
sequences, we narrowed down the choice of sequences using the following four criteria:
(a) sequences should have a nonneutral isoelectric point, (b) they should be assigned to
the correct SCOP family by Superfamily with good E-values, (c) they should have good
Pfam similarity scores, and (d) they should have at most 15 mutations that drastically
change the amino acid type compared to the wildtype protein (such a change is defined
by a Blosum62 similarity score between the two amino acid types of -2 or less). Applying
these criteria reduced the number of sequences to 66 from the P =8 model and 45 from the
P =4 model. In addition, we eliminated sequences that had two mutations that created a
buried cavity and those that had net protein charges of +6 or more (which could lead to
protein instability). A total of six sequences were chosen for further analysis. We refer to
them as sequences 1‚Äì6 or seq-1, ..., seq-6. Sequences 1, 2, 4, and 5 were modified further
manually to eliminate charged residues in the exposed loop 852‚Äì856 (lysines were changed
manually to alanine), giving sequences 1‚Äô, 2‚Äô, 4‚Äô, and 5‚Äô. The ten sequences are shown in
Fig. 6A. Using these sequences as queries to search Uniprot with Blast, the top hits were
either Tiam1 mammalian orthologs (including human Tiam1) or uncharacterized proteins,
with identity scores between 35 and 40% and Blast E-values of around 10‚àí8 ‚Äì10‚àí7 (except
for one sequence which gave hits with lower E-values of around 10‚àí10 ).
All ten sequences were subjected to MD simulations with explicit solvent. Initial
simulations were run for 100 ns, with all ten sequences exhibiting good stability. Six were
extended to lengths of 500 or 1000 ns. The wildtype protein (WT) was also simulated
19

for 1000 ns. The WT sequence appeared stable over the entire simulation, judging by
its rms deviations from the wildtype (WT) X-ray structure and from its own mean MD
structure (Fig. 6B). The mean MD structure had a backbone rms deviation of 1.0 AÃä from
the WT X-ray structure (excluding 3‚Äì4 residues at each terminus and one very flexible
loop, residues 850‚Äì857). During the MD trajectory, the rms deviation from the mean
MD structure varied in the range 1‚Äì1.5 AÃä, without any visible drift (Fig. 6B). A weakly
stable quadruple mutant (QM) with an unfolding free energy of just 1 kcal/mol 70 was also
simulated for 1000 ns. The mean MD structure of QM had a backbone rms deviation of
1.6 AÃä relative to the QM X-ray structure (4NXQ). Note that the X-ray structure includes
a peptide ligand, whereas the MD simulation represents the apo state. The average MD
structure of QM (Fig. 6C) exhibited some unwinding of the N-terminus of the Œ±2 helix.
During the QM simulation, the structure had deviations from its average MD structure
in the 0.8‚Äì1.2 AÃä range (Fig. 6B) and appeared stable.
Sequences 1, 3, 4, and 5 were simulated for 500 ns; sequence 3 moved away from the
mean MD structure towards the end of the simulation; the other three sequences appeared
stable (Fig. 6B). Sequence 2 (or seq-2) appeared stable up to almost 1000 ns (Fig. 6B).
The mean seq-2 structure exhibited a shortening of the Œ≤ strands 2 and 3. Note that in
the holo state, strand 2 makes direct contacts with the peptide ligand. The rms deviations
between the average MD structure of seq-2 and the WT and QM X-ray structures were
1.5 and 1.6 AÃä, respectively. During the seq-2 MD simulation, the rms deviation of seq-2
from its average MD structure varied in the range 1.3‚Äì2 AÃä up to almost 1000 ns. At this
point, just before 1000 ns, seq-2 underwent a large fluctuation. Extending the simulation
for another 100 ns, the fluctuation largely regressed. More data are needed to determine
if this fluctuation signals instability of this designed sequence.
Sequence 6 appeared stable throughout the microsecond MD simulation (Fig. 6B).
The mean MD structure had a backbone rms deviation from the WT X-ray structure of
just 1.0 AÃä, the same deviation as the mean WT MD structure. The mean MD structures
of seq-6 and WT are superimposed in Fig. 6C and are very similar to each other, with a
1.2 AÃä backbone deviation between them. During the seq-6 MD trajectory, the deviations
of seq-6 away from its mean MD structure fluctuated between about 1 and 1.5 AÃä, without
any visible drift over the microsecond MD simulation.

Application: growing the PDZ hydrophobic core

As a first application of our optimized models, we examined the designability of the Tiam1
and Cask hydrophobic cores. Each PDZ domain was subjected to Replica Exchange
Monte Carlo simulations with a succession of biased energy functions that increasingly
favored hydrophobic residues. The first simulation included a bias energy term Œ¥ = 0.4
kcal/mol (per position) that penalized hydrophobic amino acid types (ILMVAWFY). The
final simulation included a bias energy term Œ¥ = -0.4 kcal/mol (per position) that favored
hydrophobic types. Intermediate bias energy values Œ¥ = 0.2, 0, and -0.2 kcal/mol were
also simulated. By gradually decreasing the bias energy value Œ¥, we effectively ‚Äútitrate
in‚Äù hydrophobic residues.
The results for Tiam1 are illustrated in Fig. 7. At the largest Œ¥ value, the Tiam1
hydrophobic core was depleted, with 10 amino acid positions (out of 94) changed to polar
types. The changed positions mostly lie on the outer edge of the core. At the intermediate
Œ¥ values, the hydrophobic core remained native-like. At the most negative Œ¥ value, the
hydrophobic core became larger, expanding out towards surface regions, with 14 polar
positions changed to hydrophobic types. Thus, the numbers of positions changed were
approximately symmetric (around ¬±12 changes), reflecting the bias. About 2/3 of the
changes were in secondary structure elements. Overall, the observed propensities of each
position to become polar or hydrophobic in the presence of a large or small penalty bias
energy Œ¥ can be thought of as a hydrophobic designability index. Here, 11 of the 14
conserved core positions (all but positions 884, 898 and 903) remained hydrophobic even
at the highest level of polar bias, along with 13 other positions, indicating that these
positions have the highest hydrophobic propensity. Furthermore, 14 positions changed
from polar to hydrophobic at the highest bias level, indicating that these positions also
have a certain hydrophobic propensity. Results for Cask were similar, with 11 positions
changed to polar at the highest polar bias and 9 changed to hydrophobic at the highest
hydrophobic bias.
We also derived a parameter to describe the relative number of amino acid type
changes per unit bias energy. This parameter was defined as the number Œ¥N of residue
positions changed from nonpolar to polar, divided by the product of the change Œ¥E in
bias energy and the mean number N of nonpolar positions at zero bias. We call it the

21

hydrophobic susceptibility, œáh . For the Tiam1 PDZ domain, this calculation amounts to
œáh =

1 Œ¥N
N Œ¥E

= 0.88 changes (per position) per kcal/mol. For Cask, the susceptibility was

œáh = 0.71 changes per kcal/mol.

4.6

Application to Tiam1: designing specificity positions

As a second application, we redesigned four amino acid positions in the Tiam1 PDZ
domain known to contribute to peptide binding specificity. Modifying these four positions
(quadruple mutant or QM) in the protein altered the binding specificity such that QM
preferentially bound a Caspr4 peptide relative to a syndecan-1 (Sdc1) peptide 70,73 . The
four mutations in the QM PDZ domain were L911M, K912E, L915F, and L920V. All
four positions but Lys912 are part of the conserved hydrophobic core. The four single
and two double mutants were also characterized experimentally 70,73 . For simplicity, we
denote the native (WT) sequence as LKLL and the quadruple mutant (QM) as MEFV.
Other variants are denoted similarly. Replica Exchange MC simulations were conducted
on several structural templates, where all four positions could mutate simultaneously,
into all amino acid types except Gly and Pro. We used the Proteus model with the lower
dielectric constant, P =4, which gave similarity scores equivalent to the P =8 model but
had a reduced tendency to bury polar sidechains, thanks to its lower dielectric constant.
In addition, no bias energy term was used, only the MMGBSA energy function. The CPD
model used either the wildtype or the quadruple mutant crystal structure as backbone
template for the design (PDB codes 4GVD and 4NXQ, respectively), shown in Fig. 8.
Although these two structures were determined with the Sdc1 and Caspr4 ligands, they
were used here for both holo and apo design simulations. The backbone rms deviation
between these structures is 0.9 AÃä, with the main differences in the flexible 850‚Äì857 loop
near the peptide C-terminus and in helix Œ±2 . This helix is pushed slightly outwards in
the mutant complex, to accomodate Phe side chains both at protein position 915 and at
the peptide C-terminus. One expectation is that the mutant backbone model (4NXQ)
will better describe variants with Phe at position 915 and the wildtype backbone model
(4GVD) will better describe variants with a smaller 915 sidechain.
We studied six systems: the Tiam1 PDZ domain with either its wildtype or QM
backbone X-ray structure, with the syndecan1 or the Caspr4 peptide ligand or no ligand.
22

Results are shown in Fig. 8. For all six systems, the native or native-like amino acid types
were sampled at all four designed positions. For example, using the wildtype backbone
structure (4GVD), Leu911 was preserved in the apo simulations and changed to Ile or Val
in the holo simulations. Similarly, holo simulations with the mutant backbone structure
(4NXQ) sampled Ile, Leu and Met. With the mutant backbone, holo simulations sampled
somewhat different types at position 911 (Trp, Arg, Lys), which all appear in low amounts
at the corresponding position in the Pfam seed alignment. All the simulations sampled
mostly Arg, Lys, Gln and occasionally Glu at position 912, and mostly Leu and Val
at position 920, similar to the wildtype sequence. Not surprisingly, agreement with the
wildtype sequence was better with the wildtype X-ray structure, while agreement with
the mutant sequence was better with the mutant X-ray structure.
Recovery of the precise native and quadruple mutant sequences in the different states
(apo and holo) was qualitative. Thus, using the wildtype backbone structure and in the
apo state, the MC simulation recovered the wildtype sequence LKLL just 2 kcal/mol above
the lowest energy sequence (KKLV). The LKML homolog was the second best sequence
overall, and the homologs IKLL and LKLV were just 1‚Äì2 kcal/mol higher in energy. The
mutant sequence MEFV did not appear, nor did any close homologs, probably because
the wildtype backbone structure cannot accomodate Phe at position 915. Similar results
were obtained with the Sdc1 ligand, with the LKLL, IKLL, VKLL, and MKLL sequences
all having energies just 1‚Äì2 kcal/mol above the best sequence. The MKLL:Sdc1 affinity is
known experimentally, and is within 0.1 kcal/mol of the wildtype value 73 . Experimentally,
the wildtype and mutant sequences have the same binding free energy for Caspr4, and
stabilities just 2 kcal/mol apart, suggesting that both should be sampled. Instead, neither
was sampled. The closest homolog sequence was IEAV (similar to MEFV), at +2 kcal/mol
(relative to the best sequence). This was probably due to steric conflict between position
915 (L or F) and the Caspr4 Phe0 in this backbone geometry.
Using the mutant backbone structure (4NXQ) and in the apo state, the room temperature Monte Carlo replica recovered the mutant sequence MEFV at an energy of +5
kcal/mol (relative to the best sequence) and the wildtype sequence LKLL at +7 kcal/mol.
Both protein variants are thermodynamically stable; a slightly higher energy to produce
LKLL seems reasonable, since the design simulation used the mutant backbone structure, which presumably should favor MEFV. With the Sdc1 ligand, MEFV appeared at
23

an energy of +6 kcal/mol, relative to the best sequence, which was the close wildtype
homolog IKLV. VKVL was just 3 kcal/mol higher. With the Caspr4 ligand, the mutant
sequence appeared at an energy of +7 kcal/mol, compared to the best sequence, TKMV.
Its homologs MQMV and MEMV appeared at +5 kcal/mol. The wildtype LKLL and its
close homologs did not appear (indicating poorer energies), while MAFI was the second
best sequence overall.
A more detailed comparison is possible with the binding affinities of the experimentally characterized mutants 73 . The experiments show that (1) affinity changes associated
with each position are roughly independent of the other positions (coupling free energies
of 0.4 kcal/mol or less between positions); (2) homologous changes to Leu911, Leu915, and
Val920 have a very small effect on the affinity; (3) changing Lys912 to Glu reduces binding by about 0.5‚Äì1 kcal/mol (for both peptides, possibly due to lost interactions with the
Lys methylenes); (4) changing Leu915 to Phe affects binding differently depending on the
residue type at position 912 type and the peptide. These properties are mostly reproduced
by our simulations. With the wildtype backbone model, considering sequences of the form
NKNN (where N ‚àà {I,L,V,M}), the mean apo and Sdc1-bound energies are 0.9¬±0.6 and
1.1¬±0.5 kcal/mol, respectively, which leads to a mean affinity of 0.2¬±0.8 kcal/mol (relative to IKLL, taken as a reference): mutations between the amino acid types I, L, V, and
M (N to N‚Äô mutations) change the Sdc1 affinity very little, consistent with experiment.
Comparing the apo and holo energies sampled in our design simulations, we predict that
NKNN ‚Üí NENN mutations lead to affinity changes of +0.75 kcal/mol for both peptides,
compared to 0.94 kcal/mol (Sdc1) and 0.55 kcal/mol (Caspr4) experimentally. Similarly,
we predict that NKNN ‚Üí NKFN mutations reduce the affinity by 0.5 kcal/mol for both
peptides, compared to 1.2 and 0.8 kcal/mol experimentally. Only for NENN ‚Üí NEFN
mutations do we see larger errors: we predict a 0.5 kcal/mol affinity loss for Sdc1 (vs. no
loss experimentally) and a 0.9 kcal/mol loss for Caspr4 (vs. a 0.5 kcal/mol gain experimentally). Specificity changes are predicted to be small, in qualitative agreement with
experiment. For example the MKFV ‚Üí MEFV mutation favors Caspr4, relative to Sdc1,
by 0.2 kcal/mol, compared to 0.5 kcal/mol experimentally for the homologous LKLL ‚Üí
LELL mutation.
The simulations also gave information on correlations between the four mutating
positions. Fig. 8C shows covariance plots between positions 911 and 912 for the apo
24

and holo simulations. Position 911 was more diverse in the apo than in either holo
state (Sdc1 or Caspr4), while 912 was not very sensitive to the peptide. The computed
pairwise correlations between all four protein positions were weak, so that the covariance
plots mostly exhibit horizontal and vertical lines or bands, without noticeable ‚Äúdiagonal‚Äù
features. This agrees with the experimental affinities of the single, double, and quadruple
mutants, where the affinity changes associated with each point mutation were only weakly
coupled to the other positions 73 .

Discussion

5.1

Model limitations

We have parameterized a simple CPD model for PDZ design, suitable for high-throughput
design applications and implemented in the Proteus software. For the folded state representation, we use a high-quality protein force field and Generalized Born solvent model.
We tested two sets of atomic surface energy parameters œÉi and two protein dielectric
constants P , quantities that characterize the solvent model and are the main empirical
parameters in the folded state energy function. We used a specific set of X-ray structures
as our test proteins, each with a specific backbone conformation. For the sidechains, we
used a simple, discrete rotamer library and a short minimization of each sidechain pair
during the energy matrix calculation to alleviate the discrete rotamer approximation.
Both the energy function and the rotamer description have been extensively tested and
shown to give very good performance for sidechain reconstruction tests 54 (comparable to
the popular Scwrl4 program 53 ) and good performance for a large set of protein acid/base
constants 74 (superior to the Rosetta software 75 , despite extensive ad hoc parameter tuning).
The unfolded state representation used a simple, implicit model, characterized by a
set of empirical, amino acid chemical potentials or reference energies. These energies were
chosen by a likelihood maximization procedure, formulated here, in order to reproduce
the amino acid composition of carefully selected natural homologs. The unfolded state
description used here is more refined than previously 76 , since distinct reference energy
values were used for amino acid positions that are buried or exposed in the folded state.
25

This method assumes that there is residual structure in the unfolded state, with some
positions more buried than others. Furthermore, it should make the parameterization
more robust and less sensitive to the size and structure of the natural homologs used to
define the target amino acid compositions, because the amino acid frequencies of exposed
and buried regions are averaged separately. In principle, this doubles the number of
adjustable reference energies. However, we reduced this number by introducing amino
acid similarity classes, with one adjustable reference energy per class. To optimize the
reference energies, we performed design calculations for each test protein (apo state)
where half of the amino positions could mutate at a time (excluding Gly and Pro), with
distinct simulations for each half. This way, during parameter optimization, a mutating
position was always surrounded by an environment at least 50% identical to the wildtype
sequence. The design calculations relied on a powerful and efficient Replica Exchange
Monte Carlo exploration method that used over a half billion steps per simulation (per
replica), and produced thousands of designed sequences in a single simulation. Reference
energy values were optimized with two different choices for the protein dielectric constant
P . The performance levels were similar with both values.
The model has several limitations, most of which are widespread in CPD implementations and applications. The first is the use of protein stability as the sole design criterion,
without explicitly accounting for fold specificity 77 , protection against aggregation, or functional considerations like ligand binding. We note, however, that the Superfamily tests
did not lead to any fold misassignments (sequences that prefer another SCOP fold), so
that in practice, fold specificity was achieved. Functional criteria can also be introduced
in an ad hoc way; for example, the sequences tested by MD were designed with 11 peptide
binding residues fixed, to facilitate future experimental studies.
A second model limitation is the use of a fixed protein backbone. In fact, the backbone
is not really fixed: rather, certain motions are allowed but modeled implicitly, through the
use of a protein dielectric constant greater than one (P = 4 or 8) 78 . This dielectric value
means that the protein structure (including its backbone) is allowed to relax or reorganize in response to charge redistribution associated with mutations or sidechain rotamer
changes. However the reorganization is modeled implicitly, not explicitly 78 , and it does
not involve motion of the atomic centers or their associated van der Waals spheres. Thus,
the backbone cannot reorganize in response to steric repulsion produced by mutations or
26

rotamer changes, nor can it shift to fill space left empty by a mutation. The effect of this
approximation was apparent in the design of the four Tiam1 specificity positions, where
the designed sequences were sensitive to the particular backbone conformation of the protein and peptide. Specifically, with the wildtype backbone structure, there was no room
to insert a Phe sidechain at position 915, even though Phe915 is present in the experimental quadruple mutant (which has a slightly different backbone structure). Therefore,
the choice of the initial X-ray structural model is important, and several strategies are
possible. Here, to parameterize the CPD model, we used X-ray structures solved with
a peptide ligand, even though the parameterization simulations and most of the testing
were done for the apo proteins. This choice was made partly because the apo/holo PDZ
structures are quite similar and partly to make the model more transferable and facilitate
applications to peptide binding. Another strategy could have been to parameterize the
model using all apo structures, then switch to holo structures for the Tiam1 application.
For whole protein design (such as the hydrophobic titration application), the use of a
fixed backbone can be partly counterbalanced by designing two or more PDZ structures.
For example, pooling the designed Tiam1 and Cask sequences gave a mean sequence
entropy comparable to the experimental Pfam set, and allowed us to recapitulate more
sequences than design with just one backbone. In the application to Tiam1 4-position
design, the fixed backbone was also counterbalanced by doing calculations separately with
two different backbone structures, a holo wildtype and a holo mutant structure. Simulations with the mutant backbone allowed us to obtain mutants having Phe at position 915.
Notice that a new method for multibackbone design was recently developed in Proteus,
based on a novel, non-heuristic hybrid Monte Carlo method that preserves Boltzmann
sampling 35 . This method could be applied in the future.
A third limitation of our model is the need, for optimal results, to parameterize the
reference energies specifically for a given set of proteins. This step is well-automated
and highly parallel. However, it involves several choices that are partly arbitrary. These
include the choice of a set of protein domains to represent the protein or family of interest.
We also need to choose a similarity threshold to define the target homologs from which
we compute the experimental amino acid compositions. Here, we chose to use close
homologs of each family member, compute their compositions, then average over the two
family representatives. This method worked well but other choices are possible, and more
27

work is needed to draw definitive conclusions. Also, the mono-position design of Tiam1
showed evidence of some systematic error (Fig. 4), with a large fraction of Arg, Lys, and
Gln residues types on the protein surface, despite the optimized reference energies. In
the future, it may be necessary to relax the intra-group constraints towards the end of
the reference energy optimization and/or target smaller numbers of mutating positions,
instead of one half of the protein at a time.
A fourth limitation of our model is the discrete rotamer approximation, which requires
some adaptation of the energy function to avoid exaggerated steric clashes; the method
used here is the residue-pair minimization method described earlier 26,76 . A fifth limitation
is the use of a pairwise additive solvation model (as in most CPD models). Specifically,
the dielectric environment of each residue pair is assumed here to be native-like (so-called
‚ÄúNative Environment approximation‚Äù or NEA 74,76 ). This leads to an energy function that
has the form of a sum over pairs of residues and that can be pre-calculated and stored
in an energy matrix, which then serves as a lookup table during the subsequent Monte
Carlo simulations. Despite this approximation, the model gave good results for a large
acid/base benchmark, a problem that is very sensitive to the electrostatic treatment 74 .
Some of these limitations could be removed in future work. In particular, since the
energy function is mostly physics-based, it can benefit rapidly from ongoing improvements in protein force fields and solvation models. Thus, the NEA approximation could
be removed in the future due to the recent implementation (manuscript in preparation)
of a more exact Generalized Born calculation, whose efficiency is comparable to the pairwise approximation 79 . We have also implemented an improved model for hydrophobic
solvation 80 , which is faster and more accurate than our current surface area energy term
(manuscript in preparation).

Model testing and applications

Designed sequences were extensively compared to natural sequences, through fold recognition tests, similarity calculations, and entropy calculations. In the test simulations, we
designed the entire protein sequence, so that all positions (except Gly and Pro) could
mutate freely, subject only to an overall bias towards the mean, experimental amino acid
composition (through the reference energies). Despite the lack of experimental bias or
28

constraints, the resulting sequences had a high overall similarity to the natural, Pfam sequences, as measured by the Blosum40 similarity scores. The scores obtained were mostly
comparable to the similarity scores between pairs of Pfam sequences themselves. Thus,
the sequences designed with Proteus resemble moderately-distant natural homologs. The
similarity was very strong for residues in the core of the protein, as observed in previous
CPD studies 30,72 . In contrast, for residues at the protein surface, similarity scores were
close to zero, the score one would obtain if one picked amino acid types randomly. Notice that many surface residues are involved in functional interactions, such as the eleven
peptide-binding residues in PDZ domains. Surface residues are also selected by evolution
to avoid aggregation or unwanted adhesion. Most of these functional constraints are not
explicitly accounted for in our design protocol (although the energy function indirectly
favors protein solubility). Despite the limited similarity scores for surface regions, fold
recognition with the Superfamily tool and the best design models was almost perfect.
Earlier fold recognition tests that used a simpler energy function gave a lower fold recognition rate of about 85% (for a larger and more diverse test set) and lower similarities 15,50 .
Evidently, the combined use of an improved protein force field, Generalized Born solvent,
and family-specific reference energies leads to designed sequences that are more native-like
and presumably better.
The Proteus sequences were also compared to sequences designed with the Rosetta
software (using default parameters), which has itself been extensively tested. Based on the
Blosum similarity scores (vs. natural sequences in Pfam) and the fold recognition tests,
the Proteus and Rosetta sequences appear to be of about the same quality. However,
Rosetta makes fewer mutations than Proteus, so that the identity scores, compared to
the corresponding wildtype protein, are about 6 percent points higher. This means that
Proteus mutates about five more positions, on average, per PDZ domain. This number
could easily be reduced, by adding to the Proteus energy function an explicit bias energy
term that increases with the number of mutations (away from the wildtype sequence). An
equivalent bias energy was used above for just two simulations of Tiam1 and Cask (see
the ‚Äúbiased Proteus‚Äù results in the two upper panels of Fig. 5), to illustrate the possibility
of using experimentally-restrained sampling. It remains to be seen whether a restraint
based on the identity score would lead to more stable and realistic designed sequences.
Another attractive route for testing designed sequences is through high-level MD sim29

ulations. Here, ten designed Tiam1 sequences were tested in rather long MD simulations,
in the apo form, using the same protein force field as in the CPD model (Amber force
field) and an established explicit water model. These sequences were designed using Proteus, with Gly, Pro, and eleven peptide-binding positions held fixed but all others free to
mutate. Seven of the sequences remained stable over 200 ns simulation lengths and two
were extended up to a microsecond, which represents a very stringent test of the designs.
Sequence 6 was stable over the whole microsecond. Its mean deviation from the starting,
experimental wildtype structure was 1 AÃä, which is the same as the mean deviation in the
MD simulation of the wildtype sequence itself. The deviation between the mean sequence
6 MD structure and the mean wildtype MD structure was also small, just 1.2 AÃä. Sequence
2 was also simulated and remained stable until just before the end of the microsecond
simulation, at which point it underwent a larger fluctuation. The fluctuation regressed
100 ns later. An even longer simulation would be needed to determine if this fluctuation
is harmless or signals the beginning of domain unfolding. Note that in the presence of a
peptide ligand, we expect the structural stability of the designed domains would increase
further. MD simulations of additional designed sequences would also be of interest. Direct
experimental testing of the designed proteins remains to be done.
The CPD model was used for two applications. ‚ÄúHydrophobic titration‚Äù of two
PDZ domains illustrated a novel way to characterize protein designability. The cost or
availability of hydrophobic sidechain types was controlled by a bias energy term that
was gradually varied. One result was that the mean overall hydrophobic ‚Äúsusceptibility‚Äù,
the number of type changes per kcal/mol and per position, differed by a factor of two
between Tiam1 and Cask. In Tiam1, 12 of the core positions remained hydrophobic
even with the largest bias value favoring polar types, while 17 other positions changed to
polar (respectively, nonpolar) types at the largest polar (nonpolar) bias energy values. A
comparison to other domain families would be of interest, and is left for future work.
Redesign of four specificity positions in Tiam1 allowed us to test the design model
in a different way. It revealed some of the limitations of fixed backbone design, but also
gave semi-quantitative agreement with available binding free energies. This agreement
predicts new mutations that could be of interest for obtaining new specificity properties.
They remain to be studied further and tested experimentally. Here, the apo and two holo
states were studied, and designed separately. Information about binding affinities and
30

binding specificity were then obtained by comparing the energies sampled in the different
simulations. In the future, we would like to include binding affinity and/or specificity
directly in the design calculations, as a property to be designed for or against within a
single simulation. In addition, we should allow different backbone structures for the apo
and each holo system. This could be done in the future, since recent hybrid Monte Carlo
schemes 35,81 can be used for multi-backbone design, and can be extended to the problem
of designing ligand binding specificity. We also note that since our energy function is
physics-based, it has transferability to a range of molecule types, such as nonnatural
amino acids (considered in an earlier protein-ligand design study 34 ). Such amino acids
could be of interest for designing PDZ peptide ligands, to provide additional diversity and
perhaps enhanced resistance to proteolysis.

Figure 1: A) Three dimensional view of four PDZ domains. The CŒ≤ atoms of fourteen
hydrophobic core residues are shown as spheres. Three core positions designed in this work
are labelled (Tiam1 numbers). B) Cluster representation of the PDZ domains studied.
The links between domains are labeled with the percent identity scores and backbone rms
deviations (AÃä); the number in parentheses is the number of aligned CŒ± atoms used to
compute the rms deviation.

Figure 3: Sequence logos for the conserved hydrophobic core of designed and natural
Tiam1 and Cask sequences. ‚ÄúHom.‚Äù corresponds to the homologs that make up our
target set of sequences (used for Etr optimization). ‚ÄúPfam‚Äù corresponds to the Pfam
seed alignment. Proteus sequences were generated with model P =8. The height of each
letter is proportional to the abundance of each type at the corresponding position in
the Proteus/Rosetta simulations or the natural sequences. The color of each letter is
determined by the physical chemical properties of each amino acid type.

Figure 5: Histogram plots showing similarity scores for designed PDZ sequences. Similarity
scores for Tiam1 (left) and Cask (right), relative to the Pfam-RP55 alignment. The scores were
computed for all positions (top), 14 core positions (middle), and 16 surface positions (bottom).
Values are shown for Proteus, Rosetta, and Pfam sequences (all compared to RP55). The
similarity score of the wildtype sequence is indicated in each panel by a vertical arrow. The top
panels include results for Proteus simulations where a bias energy was included, which explicitly
favors sequences that are similar to Pfam (dotted lines, labeled ‚ÄúBiased Proteus‚Äù). Notice that
the designed sequences represented in each top, middle, or bottom panel were the same; only
the positions included in the similarity score calculation differ between panels.
